    <p>Traveling Helps You See the World in a Whole New Way. Traveling to a different country means exploring new cultures and new ideas that can drastically 
        <br> shift your way of thinking and interacting with the world. It breaks down barriers, builds understanding, and connects people in unique ways. 
        <br> Travel gives us our greatest stories, our most cherished memories and countless irreplaceable learnings that we can choose to pay forward to others.
        <br> It teaches us about ourselves and each other, it broadens our horizons and, just like a reset button, it forces us to refocus on what really matters.</p>
